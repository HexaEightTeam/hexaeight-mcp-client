## Quick Setup Guide (2-5 Minutes) ✨

### 🔧 Step 1: Download HexaEight App & Generate Resources (2-4 minutes)

**Option A: Generic Resources (2 minutes)**
- 📱 Download 'HexaEight Authenticator' (iOS/Android)
- ✅ Register with any email address
- 🎲 Tap "Create Generic Resource" → generates `storm23-cloud-wave-bright09`
- ✅ Identity ready instantly!

**Option B: Domain Resources (4 minutes - if you want branded agents)**

## License Architecture 💡

### 🏗️ **License Model: CPU-Based Pricing**

```
💰 Pricing Examples:
   • 1 CPU License: $15 for 5 days
   • 2 CPU License: $30 for 5 days  
   • 4 CPU License: $59 for 5 days
   
🎯 Strategy: Buy minimal CPU license → Generate unlimited child agents
```

## License Activation Process 🎯

### 🛒 Step 1: Purchase License
- 🌐 Visit: https://store.hexaeight.com
- 💡 Select CPU count based on your machine
- 💳 Choose license duration (5 days minimum recommended)

### 🔧 Step 2: Activate License

```bash
hexaeight-start license-activation
```
- 🎯 Enter your resource name (generic or domain-based)
- 📱 Generates a QR Code link (Open the link in browser)
- ⚡ Scan the QR code using the identity Resource available in HexaEight app
- 🔐 Approve Identity assignment in Mobile App to activate the agent to use the identity
- ⏎ Press Enter to complete the activation process

### 🎉 Step 3: Verify Success
- 📄 `hexaeight.mac` license file created
- 🚀 Ready for agent generation

---

### 📁 Step 4: Create Organized Workspace (1 minute)
```bash
hexaeight-create directory-linked-to-hexaeight-license my-ai-project
cd my-ai-project
```
This creates a dedicated workspace with proper license linking for your AI agent development so that the original license files present in the license directories are protected.

## Immediate Next Steps 🚀

### 🏢 **Core Setup Sequence**

1. **Generate Agent Configurations**
   ```bash
   hexaeight-start generate-parent-or-child-agent-licenses
   ```

2. **Deploy Sample System** (see multi-agent coordination in action)
   ```bash
   hexaeight-deploy multi-ai-agent-samples
   ```

3. **Setup Portable Child Environments** (deploy anywhere)
   ```bash
   hexaeight-setup portable-child-agent-environment child_config.json
   ```

## Agent Architecture 🏗️

### 👑 **Parent Agent Capabilities**
Parent agents run on your licensed machine and provide three critical functions:

1. **🏭 Child Agent Generation**
   - Create unlimited child agents during license period
   - Each child agent requires 32+ character password
   - Child agents never expire (permanent workforce)

2. **📋 Task Creation & Delegation**
   - Only parent agents can create complex tasks
   - Delegate work across multiple child agents
   - Coordinate multi-agent workflows

3. **🌐 Cross-Domain Communication**
   - Direct secure communication between parent agents
   - Example: `agent01.weatherapi.com` ↔ `agent02.hotelapi.com`
   - No application boundaries or PubSub server required
   - Enterprise-level inter-domain coordination

### 👥 **Child Agent Characteristics & Limitations**

**✅ Child Agent Strengths:**
- ♾️ Never expire (work forever)
- 🌍 Deploy anywhere (cloud, edge, mobile, IoT)
- 🔐 Full encryption capabilities
- 💰 Zero ongoing licensing costs

**⚠️ Child Agent Boundaries:**
- **Application Perimeter:** Bound to specific applications
- **Same-App Communication:** Can communicate with other child agents via PubSub only within the same application
- **Cross-App Limitation:** Cannot directly contact child agents from different applications
- **Approval Required:** Need application-level approval for communication
- **Cross-Border Protocol:** Must use parent agent for inter-application communication

### 🏢 **Communication Architecture**

```
┌─────────────────┐    Direct Secure    ┌─────────────────┐
│   Parent Agent  │ ←──── Channel ────→ │   Parent Agent  │
│ (weatherapi.com)│                     │  (hotelapi.com) │
└─────────────────┘                     └─────────────────┘
         │                                       │
         │ Delegates                             │ Delegates
         ▼                                       ▼
┌─────────────────┐    PubSub Channel    ┌─────────────────┐
│   Child Agents  │ ←──── Same App ────→ │   Child Agents  │
│   (App Bound)   │                      │   (App Bound)   │
└─────────────────┘                      └─────────────────┘
```

### 🎯 **Strategic Recommendations**

**During License Period:**
- ✅ Create parent agent configuration immediately
- ✅ Generate 10-20 child agents (they're permanent!)
- ✅ Test multi-agent coordination with samples
- ✅ Deploy child agents to target environments

**Post-License Period:**
- ✅ Child agents continue working indefinitely
- ✅ Use parent agent for task delegation (while license active)
- ✅ Leverage cross-domain communication capabilities
